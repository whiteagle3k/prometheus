# Prometheus Debug Output Fixes

This document describes the fixes implemented to address the following issues:

1. Noisy output from llama.cpp during model loading
2. External LLM provider interface compatibility (OpenAIProvider/store_memory_points)
3. Noisy debug output in the CLI interface

## Changes Made

### 1. Reducing llama.cpp Noise

We added code to `core/llm/local_llm.py` to:
- Set environment variable `LLAMA_DEBUG=0`
- Temporarily redirect stderr during import of llama_cpp
- Use a null writer class to discard debug output

### 2. Patched Base Entity Debug Output

We created `patch_debugging.py` to:
- Remove debug statements in the BaseEntity class
- Clean up the _display_debug_summary method to avoid excessive output
- Fix output formatting in the CLI for a cleaner user experience

### 3. Improved CLI Output Formatting

Our patches to `core/cli.py` now:
- Extract response text from different possible response formats
- Format routing information (e.g., "Route: LOCAL, Time: 10.2s")
- Display a cleaner, more user-friendly output

## How to Test

1. Run `./patch_debugging.py` to apply all patches
2. Restart Prometheus and check the output format in shell mode
3. Verify that llama.cpp noise during model loading is gone
4. Confirm that memory points storage works correctly with external providers

## Usage Example

```
$ python -m prometheus shell
üêö Aletheia Interactive Shell
========================================
Commands:
  - Type your message and press Enter
  - Type 'quit', 'exit' or Ctrl+C to exit
  - All conversations use user_id='terminal'
========================================

üó£Ô∏è You: What is the capital of France?
ü§î Thinking...

ü§ñ Aletheia: The capital of France is Paris.
Route: LOCAL (llama2), Time: 2.3s
```

## Known Issues

1. The `store_memory_points` method in OpenAIProvider may still need further implementation to properly store structured memory points
2. Some debug output might still appear in certain error conditions
